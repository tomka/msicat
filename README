msicat
======

Msicat prints most of the available Windows MSI registry information.
It allows you to declare two different filters to reduce the result
size. The progrim will go through all MIS entries and if a filter is
given it will only print entries on which the filter matches. An entry
consists of a number of attributes with correspoding attribute-values.
The filters are checked against them. To be in the result set on entry
needs at least one match.

Usage
-----

Synopsis: msicat [ attribute=value | attribute==value ]

If you specify no filter all the MSI entries get listed. The "=" filter
is not strict about the velue. The valua needs only to be part of the
attribute-value of the real entry. With "==" you will get strict results.
Only if the value equals the attribute-value of the current entry it will
yield true.

All the code is MIT licenced and you could do whatever you want with that
code. Some of the MSI related code was found by me on the web and
unfortunately, I don't seem to find it anymore. The source web site does
not seem to exst anymore, but in the near future I will rewrite this part
anyway.
